node.js practice

## SocketPaint (/sockets)

- started as SocketShooter - and it will eventually evolve into one ;)
- users can collaborate in a drawing online thanks to WebSockets
- a (painfully) simple chat is also at their disposal

## TODOExplorer

- Taming MongoDB connectivity and basic CRUD
- Using Node and React to build a fullstack application
- TODOs data from database is presented on a list
```javascript
todo: {
  _id: number,
  contents: {
    linenumber: linecontent
    ...
    }
  file_path: string
}
```
